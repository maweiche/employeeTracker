# Employee Tracker

The goal of this app is to allow users to create and manage an employee database. The app allows the user to view and mange the departments, roles, and employees in the company so they can organize and plan the business accordingly. The app utilizes the MySQL2 package to connect the database and perform queries, the Inquirer package to interact with the user via the command line and gather input, and also the console.table package to print MySQL rows into the console. 

## Getting Started

The user will need to clone the repository from GitHub and `npm install` both MySQL2, Inquirer and console.table. Once installed run node server.js in your CLI to start the Inquirer Prompts.
